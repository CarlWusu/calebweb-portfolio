                experiences. With a strong foundation in JavaScript and Tailwind CSS, I believe in building web

            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>I started my coding journey in college, where I fell in love with the creativity of front-end design and
                the logic behind back-end development. Over the years, I have expanded my skills, working with modern
                frameworks and libraries like React, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS. I am constantly learning and exploring
                new technologies, striving to stay ahead in this fast-paced field.</p>

            <h3>Development Philosophy</h3>
            <p>I believe that great web development goes beyond functionality. It is about creating an experience that
                feels intuitive and engaging. My approach centers around clean code, attention to detail, and an
                emphasis on the users perspective. Every line of code is written with the user in mind, ensuring
                seamless functionality, responsiveness, and an aesthetically pleasing design.</p>
